A season consists of 38 games, with each side playing every other team twice, once at home and once away.<br/><br/>The Premier League schedule and fixtures are created meticulously considering TV broadcast agreements, club preferences, stadium availability, and travel issues. A fixture computer generates random matchups while considering travel, local events, and holidays such as Boxing Day. The schedule of Premier League matches is revealed in mid-June, giving clubs, fans, and broadcasters plenty of time to prepare. Extreme weather, health issues, logistical disruptions, or safety concerns cause postponements. The Premier League Board reviews the situation and allows postponements if there are substantial safety or health threats."

The total number of games is determined by calculating the number of matches each team performs, which is 38. Multiplying the 38 games played by each of the 20 teams yields 760 games counted from each team's perspective.<br/><br/>The number of unique matches in the season is 380, though, because each game is tallied once for the two participating teams. The system promotes a balanced competition, with each team having an equal opportunity to play at home and away, allowing for a fair determination of the league champion based on total performance.",
